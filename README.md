### Motivation
I really like music and the arts but I'm not artistically gifted:( I'd like to try using my programming skills to make something cool related to music/art.
Hopefully others will be able to take my work and add their own creative iterations.

### Concept
A web application that allows users to queue music and see music visualizations. Users can also make a group session with friends where they can listen and experience the same music and visual effects.

### Features/Goals
1. Various algorithms for audio-based visual effects.
2. User Interface that allows for
- uploading of audio files/ URLs or synching with music platforms (Spotify/Apple Music/etc)
- the ability to change visual effects
- audio playback controls
- adding multiple users to a session
 3. Creating a server that connects and synchronizes music/visuals for users in an app session.
